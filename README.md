# hengameh.shahali--Semantic-Driven-Topic-Modeling-Using-Transformer-Bassed
This project implements semantic topic modeling on a collection of text documents using transformer-based embeddings and clustering algorithms DBSCAN and UMAP for dimensionality reduction. The goal is to compare semantic-driven topic modeling with traditional methods like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).
